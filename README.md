#🏥 AI-Assisted Clerking Note Drafting System
This project is an AI-assisted documentation system designed to support clinical clerking in Pediatrics and Obstetrics & Gynecology.
The system does not diagnose, predict, or make clinical decisions.
Its sole purpose is to reduce clerking time and cognitive load by drafting:
* Bio data
* Presenting complaints

from handwritten clerking notes, with mandatory clinician review.
